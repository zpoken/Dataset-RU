# What is this repo about

We are happy to present here our **Russian Speech Dataset â€” Zpoken Dataset [RU]**

At the current moment the dataset consists of 5 source parts: radio\_source\_1, radio\_source\_2, radio\_source\_3, radio\_source\_5, Ru-films.

All data is stored in .opus format and was converted to mono, 16 kHz sampling rate, 16-bit.

| Part name | Duration (h) | Samples num. | Average duration (s) | Characters per second | Characters per sample |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| radio\_source\_1 | 16 424.82 | 7 887 042 | 7.50 | 14.12 | 105.84 |
| radio\_source\_2 | 2 308.46 | 955 904 | 8.69 | 13.53 | 117.62 |
| radio\_source\_3 | 500.14 | 165 584 | 10.87 | 13.90 | 151.16 |
| radio\_source\_5 | 655.88 | 216 101 | 10.93 | 16.63 | 181.66 |
| Ru-films | 850.88 | 203 972 | 15.02 | 8.76 | 131.57 |
| Total \| Average | **20 740,18** | 9 428 603 | 7.91 | 13.95 | 106.17 |

All parts were scraped from open sources. Basically there were long audio files and transcriptions without timesteps. So that one of the challenges we solved is to align original transcription directly to each short audio sample. More about this problem you will be able to read in our future paper.

# Download & play

We provide **absolutely free to use 150 hours** demos for each part. It is a randomly selected sample from the original dataset part.
